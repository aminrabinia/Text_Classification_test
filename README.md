# Text_Classification_test

<p>You can run this Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab (link on the top) to perform a simple text classification. Open the Jupyter Notebook and upload the xlsx file and run all the cells. Last cell can receive a line of text and generate a prediction label using an LSTM model. Since the accuracy is very low at the moment it cannot generate any real output. This model can improve with a more sophisticated neural network, data preprocessing and longer training.</p>
